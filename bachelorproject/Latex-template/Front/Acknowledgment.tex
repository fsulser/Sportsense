I would like to express my thanks to Prof. Dr. Heiko Schuldt for giving me the chance to work on this interesting project.

A special thank goes to Ivan Giangreco and Ihab Al Kabary for supporting me during the whole project and supervising my work.

I also would like to thank all my fellow student who supported me if I had some questions and gave me some new ideas to solve a problem. 

Last but not least I also would like to thank all my friends and family who have been supporting me over the whole duration of my bachelor studies.
