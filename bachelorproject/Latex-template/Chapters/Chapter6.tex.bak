\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}


\section{Conclusion}
With this thesis, a system was introduced that allows annotating a sport video by using a micro-job platform. The online platform Microworkers was used to collect events by crowdsourcing users and calculating the final events by the clustering algorithm DBSCAN.
The evaluation of the tests with Microworkers has shown that it is possible to build a system where only good users can participate in campaigns and use their data.
It was shown that calculated data can only be as good as the statistical algorithm to summarize workers entered actions to new events. This approach showed that it was not possible to calculate perfect and complete data, but however, some acceptable results could be generated if the sequence is not too complex.


\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Administrator system}
To make this approach usable for external clients, one would have to extend the administrator system.
As a first change, all administrators should have the possibility to upload movies and add the parameters of the soccer game. For this, changes to the database would be necessary.
The administrator should also be able to get the calculated events from the database on the administrator system.

\section{Further Sports}

By introducing some small modifications, it would be possible to allow for other sport videos based on a field, in which multiple teams would interact in events.

With some minor modifications in the code and the database, it would be possible to annotate other type of sport in the system, which are based on a quadratic field, played with a ball and where multiple teams interact.


With these two more or less small modifications we are able to easily extend the system to other ball sports like Rugby, American Football, Tennis, Volleyball, Handball, Basketball, Field-hockey, Cricket, Baseball or Lacrosse and others.
