\chapter{Introduction}

This is the introduction of the thesis template. The goal\footnote{Furthermore, this document shows how to use the template} is to give students a help to format and style their bachelor's or master's thesis. Please make sure to always use the most current version of this template, by downloading it always from the git repository.\footnote{\url{http://www.github.com/navige/unibas-latex}} By the way, we will use throughout this tutorial some references to Turing's imitation game \cite{turing:1950} and the Turing machine \cite{turing:1936}.
